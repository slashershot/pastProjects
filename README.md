**Switch Branches to view my projects.**

Hello, I am slashershot, a software developer from Singapore.

I am currently enrolled in Nanyang Polytechnic,School of Information Technology.

This is my archive of past projects for viewing.

As you can see,my projects are varied and range from Video Streaming, Simple Server Creation to Game Making.

I prefer Java over C# as I use Linux while my team members uses Mac and Windows.

I am always in pursuit of an interesting topic to base my projects around.

In my past time, I'm learning new programming languages.
